- `3_StringPrograms/`  
  String manipulation and algorithms.

- `4_Arrays/`  
  Array related problems including sorting, searching, and manipulations.

- `5_Matrix/`  
  Matrix operations like addition, multiplication, and traversal.

- `6_SearchingSorting/`  
  Implementation of searching and sorting algorithms.

- `7_LinkedList/`  
  Linked list data structure programs.

- `8_StackQueue/`  
  Stack and queue implementations and problems.

  Other important coding problems.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your favorite Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code with Java extensions).
3. Navigate to the relevant folder and open the Java files you want to practice.
4. Compile and run the programs.
5. Each program contains comments to explain the logic.

## Why Practice Here?

- Helps me systematically cover important Java concepts.
